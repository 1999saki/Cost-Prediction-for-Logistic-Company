# Cost-Prediction-for-Logistic-Company
A logistics company is interested in optimizing its delivery network. It has provided you with a dataset of the network-wide deliveries and associated trip costs. It has tasked you with building a model that predicts the cost of deliveries.

Certainly, I'll provide a more detailed explanation of each section and remove the license and requirements sections.

# Logistics Cost Prediction Project

## Project Overview
The Logistics Cost Prediction Project is aimed at improving the operational efficiency of a logistics company's delivery network by accurately predicting the cost associated with each trip. This predictive capability allows the company to optimize its logistics operations, reduce costs, and enhance the overall management of its delivery network.

## Key Components
The project consists of several essential components:

### Data Preprocessing
In this initial phase, the dataset is prepared for modeling. The key steps include:
- **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame, making it suitable for analysis.
- **Negative Value Handling**: Negative values, which could be due to errors or outliers, are replaced with zeros to ensure data consistency.
- **Date Feature Extraction**: Date-based features, such as day of the week or month, are extracted from a date column to capture temporal patterns.
- **Scaling and Outlier Treatment**: Techniques like z-score scaling are applied to standardize data, and outliers are addressed to improve data quality.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering focuses on enhancing the model's predictive power. This is achieved through two main techniques:
- **Polynomial Regression**: By applying polynomial regression, the project creates polynomial features from the existing dataset. This helps capture nonlinear relationships between variables.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is employed for dimensionality reduction. It reduces the number of features while retaining the most critical information, which can improve model efficiency.

### Model Ensemble
Ensemble modeling combines predictions from multiple models to achieve better predictive performance. This phase involves:
- **Model Selection**: A set of advanced regression models is chosen, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Extra Trees. Each model contributes its unique strengths to the ensemble.
- **Weighted Voting**: Predictions from different models are combined using weighted voting. Weights are determined based on each model's individual performance, often measured by metrics like the R-squared (R2) score.
- **AdaBoost**: AdaBoost, an ensemble technique, is employed to further enhance overall prediction performance. It iteratively improves the model's accuracy by assigning higher weights to misclassified samples.

### Test Data Prediction
In this phase, the models are used to predict the cost of trips in a test dataset. The steps include:
- **Model Prediction**: Each previously trained model (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Extra Trees) is used to predict the cost for the test dataset.
- **Ensemble Prediction**: The predictions from these models are aggregated, and an AdaBoost model, pre-trained on the validation set, provides an ensemble prediction for the test dataset.

### Result Generation
The final predictions for trip costs, including the ensemble prediction, are consolidated into a CSV file named "result.csv." This file serves as a valuable resource for further analysis and can be shared with stakeholders.
